    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package of dumpling wrappers</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground pork</li>
      <li>2 large leaves of cabbage, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch of green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce
      <li>1/2 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
      <li>vegetable oil</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Making the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Finely mince the fresh ginger, and chop the green onions and cabbage.</li>
      <li>Put the ground pork, ginger, green onions, and cabbage into a large mixing bowl. Use a large bunch of chopsticks to mix the ingredients together.</li>
      <li>Once the filling is well-mixed, add in the soy sauce, and slowly add in water as needed. The mixture should provide a good amount of resistance and be very slightly wet.</li>
      <li>Add salt and white pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Wrapping the Potstickers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Take about 3/4 tablespoon of filling, and place it in the center of a dumpling wrapper.</li>
      <li>Dip a finger in some water, and spread water over the edges of the wrapper.</li>
      <li>Fold the wrapper tightly in half, sealing the edges you applied water to in the previous step. You may crease or fold the wrapper edge in any design you wish.</li>
      <li>Repeat until all the filling is used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pan Frying the Potstickers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan with a lid.</li>
      <li>Place the potstickers inside the pan so that they sit flatly within the pan, ensuring there is oil underneath each potsticker.</li>
      <li>Fry the bottoms of the potstickers until they are golden-brown, then add a small amount of water and close the lid to allow the potstickers to steam.</li>
      <li>Once the skin of the potstickers turns slightly transculent and most of the water has evaporated, open the lid and allow the potstickers to cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve alone or with a dipping sauce of your choosing. You may store leftover potstickers for 2-3 days in the refrigerator and reheat in the same way you initially cooked them but with a shorter duration.</li>
    </ol>
