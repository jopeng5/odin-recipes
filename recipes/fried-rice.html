    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice is a staple in Chinese cuisine, and luckily, it can be very simple in ingredients and preparation. With some rice, veggies, protein, and a pan, you can easily whip up a delicious fried rice!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of cooked rice</li>
      <li>1 pound of protein (tofu, egg, ground or diced meat of your choosing, etc.)</li>
      <li>2 cups of diced vegetables of your choosing (frozen mixed vegetables are a great quick option)</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch of green onions, chopped with the whites and greens separated</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, chopped or minced</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
      <li>vegetable oil</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mince or slice the garlic and ginger (optional), and slice the green onions, separating the whites from the greens.</li>
      <li>Dice your vegetables and/or protein, depending on what ingredients you chose.</li>
      <li>If you are using eggs and/or protein, heat 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the pan. Scramble the eggs or cook the protein through. Set aside when complete.</li>
      <li>Add more vegetable oil if needed, then add garlic, ginger, and the whites of the green onions into the oil while it's heating up, waiting until they become fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the veggies that take longer to cook (for example, just the stems). Once they soften, add the remaining veggies, and saute for 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add in the cooked rice, and mix well with the veggies. Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and salt and white pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Once the veggies and rice look almost done, add the scrambled eggs, protein, and the greens of the green onions back in.</li>
      <li>Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately, or save in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
